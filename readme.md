# Car camera controller

This is a source code for a simple MCU based on ESP32 and IC CD4051. It manages switching between 8 video inputs (front, reverse parking cameras, and whatever else you please) and a single output (the car's headunit) and intercepts CAN communications within your car's CAN network.

## Installation

The code can be compiled and uploaded to ESP32 with [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## Usage

Follow the schematic included
