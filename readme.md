# Car front camera controller

This is a source code for a simple MCU based on ESP8266 and IC CD4066. It manages switching between 2 video inputs (front and reverse parking cameras) and a single output (the car's headunit) and piggybacks on any existing car button without losing its functionality.

## Installation

The code can be compiled and uploaded to ESP8266 with [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## Usage

Follow the schematic included
